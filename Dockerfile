# Same two-stage shape used by every Node/TypeScript project in this batch
# (see HYDRA-UMC-OPCUA-SERVER, HYDRA-UMC-MQTT-BROKER and
# HYDRA-UMC-MTCONNECT-ADAPTER for the identical pattern applied to each
# child) - build stage runs the same `npm run build` a developer would run
# locally (bumps the version, bundles with esbuild into dist/server.cjs),
# runtime stage ships only the bundle plus package.json, no dev
# dependencies, no TypeScript compiler. See docker-compose.yml at this
# repo's root for how this image and its three children are wired
# together.

# Real bug found live on this image's first real run: `npm run build`
# bundles with esbuild's own `--packages=external` (see package.json's
# own build script), which deliberately does NOT inline npm dependencies
# into dist/server.cjs - they stay real require() calls expecting
# node_modules to exist at runtime. This stage never installed them,
# so every real run crashed immediately with MODULE_NOT_FOUND. Same
# `npm ci --omit=dev` pattern HYDRA-UMC-OS's own install_server.sh
# already uses for HYDRA-UMC-SERVER (also esbuild + --packages=external).
